# Home Assistant Community Add-on: Traccar

[Traccar][traccar] is a modern GPS Tracking Platform, which is now available
as an Hass.io add-on and allows you to run your GPS Tracking software
without any cloud.

Traccar supports more protocols and device models than any other GPS tracking
system on the market, straight from your Hass.io instance. You can select GPS
trackers from a variety of vendors from low-cost Chinese models to high-end
quality brands.

Traccar also has native mobile apps available for Android and iOS platforms
so that you can track those as well. AND! With the Home Assistant `traccar`
integration (introduced in 0.83) the data in Traccar will be sent back into
your Home Assistant instance as well.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

1. Ensure you have the official "MariaDB" add-on installed and running!
1. Search for the "Traccar" add-on in the Supervisor add-on store
   and install it.
1. Start the "Traccar" add-on
1. Check the logs of the "Traccar" add-on to see if everything went well.
1. Click the "OPEN WEB UI" button and log in using `admin`/`admin`.
1. Be sure to change the username, email, and password!

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
log_level: info
ssl: true
certfile: fullchain.pem
keyfile: privkey.pem
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`: Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `ssl`

Enables/Disables SSL (HTTPS) on the web interface.
Set it `true` to enable it, `false` otherwise.

### Option: `certfile`

The certificate file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default_

### Option: `keyfile`

The private key file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default_

## Integrating into Home Assistant

The `traccar` integration of Home Assistant makes it possible to transfer all
assets tracked by Traccar to appear in Home Assistant as a tracked device.

Add the following snippet to your Home Assistant `configuration.yaml` file.

```yaml
device_tracker:
  - platform: traccar
    host: localhost
    port: 18682
    username: TRACCAR_EMAIL_ADDRESS
    password: TRACCAR_PASSWORD
```

Restart Home Assistant.

## Enabling more protocols

By default, this add-on has disabled most of the GPS protocols. This has
been done to reduce the number of open ports the add-on would create.

By default, only the OsmAnd protocol (used by the Traccar Apps) and the API
are enabled. If you want more protocols, you can do so, by adding entries
to your `/config/traccar.xml` file.

A list if all entries can be found here:

<https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-traccar/blob/main/traccar/rootfs/etc/traccar/traccar.xml#L22>

To find out which protocol your device uses, please refer to the Traccar
website: <https://www.traccar.org/devices/>
