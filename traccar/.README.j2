## About

[Traccar][traccar] is a modern GPS Tracking Platform, which is now available
as an Hass.io add-on and allows you to run your GPS Tracking software without
any cloud.

Traccar supports more protocols and device models than any other GPS tracking
system on the market, straight from your Hass.io instance. You can select GPS
trackers from a variety of vendors from low-cost Chinese models to high-end
quality brands.

Traccar also has native mobile apps available for Android and iOS platforms
so that you can track those as well. AND! With the Home Assistant `traccar`
integration (introduced in 0.83) the data in Traccar will be sent back into
your Home Assistant instance as well.
